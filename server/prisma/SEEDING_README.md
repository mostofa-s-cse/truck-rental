# Database Seeding System

This document explains the comprehensive database seeding system for the Truck Rental application.

## üå± Overview

The seeding system populates your database with realistic test data for all entities in the application. It includes:

- **System Settings** - Configuration data
- **Truck Categories** - Different types of trucks with pricing
- **Areas** - Cities and locations across Bangladesh
- **Users** - Admins, drivers, and regular users
- **Drivers** - Driver profiles with truck information
- **Bookings** - Trip bookings with different statuses
- **Reviews** - User reviews and ratings
- **Messages** - Chat messages between users and drivers
- **Payments** - Payment records for completed trips
- **Tracking** - GPS tracking data for drivers
- **Emergency Alerts** - Emergency situations and alerts

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure your database is set up and migrations are applied:
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

2. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`

### Running the Seeder

```bash
# Run full seeding process (clears existing data first)
npm run seed

# Alternative commands
npm run seed:clear      # Explicitly clear and seed
npm run seed:skip-clear # Seed without clearing existing data
```

## üìã Seeding Order

The seeder runs in the following order to maintain referential integrity:

1. **System Settings** - App configuration
2. **Truck Categories** - Truck types and pricing
3. **Areas** - Cities and locations
4. **Users** - All user types (admins, drivers, regular users)
5. **Drivers** - Driver profiles linked to users
6. **Bookings** - Trip bookings linked to users and drivers
7. **Reviews** - Reviews for completed bookings
8. **Messages** - Chat messages between users
9. **Payments** - Payment records for completed bookings
10. **Tracking** - GPS data for drivers
11. **Emergency Alerts** - Emergency situations

This will use `upsert` operations to update existing records or create new ones.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check your `.env` file and `DATABASE_URL`
   - Ensure database is running

2. **Migration Errors**
   - Run `npm run db:migrate` first
   - Check for pending migrations

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure database user has write permissions
   - Check database connection settings

4. **Foreign Key Errors**
   - Run seeders in the correct order
   - Check that referenced records exist

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=prisma:* npm run seed
```

## üìù Customization

### Adding New Data

1. Create a new seeder file in `prisma/seeders/`
2. Export a function that creates the data
3. Import and call it in `prisma/seeders/index.ts`

### Modifying Existing Data

Edit the respective seeder files to change the data being created.

### Environment-Specific Data

Use environment variables to customize data:

```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
```

## üìà Performance

The seeder is optimized for performance:

- Uses `upsert` operations to avoid duplicates
- Batches operations where possible
- Proper error handling and rollback
- Progress logging for monitoring

## üîí Security Notes

- Test credentials are for development only
- Change passwords in production
- Remove sensitive data before deployment
- Use environment variables for production settings

## üìû Support

For issues with the seeding system:

1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review the logs for specific errors
3. Ensure database schema is up to date
4. Verify all dependencies are installed
